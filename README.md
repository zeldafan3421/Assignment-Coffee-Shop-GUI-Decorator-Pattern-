## Getting Started
The entrypoint is App.java. No build system is used so either use vscode or the java command to compile.

A jar file will be provided to run:
    java -jar shop.jar

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `docs`: the folder containing diagrams, instructions, and javadoc(if applicable)
- `tools` : contains any addition programs used for documentation and planning

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management
The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
